## Java Arrays and Loops

An "array" is a way to store a collection of "elements". Each array is declared with a type that indicates the type of element that it stores.
the "int[]" is an array of integers, a "String[]" is an array of string elements. 

The array is a block of memory made of all the elements together. Each element in the array is identified by an index number: 0, 1, 2, ... and so on.
An attempt to access an index outside the 0..length-1 range will fail with a runtime exception. In a new array after its created, all of the elements in the array are set to zero.
